# 🚀 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

Welcome to the **0x03 ES6 Data Manipulation** project! 🎉 Get ready to dive into the awesome world of JavaScript data handling, with a focus on some of the coolest array methods and data structures out there. It's time to level up your coding game with `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`, and explore powerful structures like `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`.

Get your favorite editor ready, and let's get started! ✨

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is all about mastering **ES6 data manipulation techniques**. Whether you're transforming arrays or managing data with `Set` and `Map`, you'll become proficient at handling all kinds of data like a pro! 🔥

By the end of this journey, you’ll know how to:

- Apply `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` like a boss! 💪
- Harness the power of **typed arrays** for blazing-fast data processing. ⚡
- Conquer **Set**, **Map**, and **WeakMap**—the Avengers of the JavaScript data world! 🦸‍♂️

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Node.js v12.11.x**: The environment where your magic happens. 🖥️
- **Jest**: Unit testing made easy. 🧪
- **Babel**: Transpile your fancy JS code into browser-ready scripts. 🛠️
- **ESLint**: Keeping your code clean and error-free! 🚨

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to unleash the power of modern JavaScript! 🚀

### 1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x

Run this in your terminal to install NodeJS and ensure everything’s set up correctly:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y

# Check the versions to be sure:
nodejs -v   # Should return v12.11.1
npm -v      # Should return v6.11.3
```

### 2. Install Project Dependencies

Once you've got Node.js ready, jump into your project directory and install the necessary packages with:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you’ve got **Jest**, **Babel**, and **ESLint** ready to help you write and test your code like a pro! 🏗️

### 3. Running Tests

To check your work and make sure everything's in top shape, use:

```bash
npm run full-test
```

This command will:

- 🔍 Run **unit tests** with Jest.
- 🧹 Run **linting** checks with ESLint to keep your code squeaky clean!

## 📋 Project Requirements

Before you dive into the code, make sure you follow these simple rules:

- All JavaScript files must have the `.js` extension and end with a new line.
- Your code will be verified using **Jest** and **ESLint**.
- Every function must be **properly exported** from its module.
- A **README.md** file (like this one) is required at the root of your project directory.

## 🧠 Data Structures & Functions

### Array Methods

- **map()**: 🚗 Transforms each element in an array and returns a new array.
- **filter()**: 🎯 Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array.
- **reduce()**: 🏋️ Combines array elements into a single value (accumulator style).

### Typed Arrays

Typed arrays are like supercharged arrays, giving you direct access to binary data for blazing-fast manipulation. Perfect for handling large amounts of data efficiently! 🏎️

### Set

A **Set** is like a VIP club—only unique values are allowed in! No duplicates here! 🎟️

### Map

A **Map** is your go-to for storing key-value pairs. The keys can be **anything**, from strings to objects. 🔑

### WeakMap

A **WeakMap** is like a **Map**, but it keeps things light! It doesn’t prevent garbage collection, which is great when you need to manage memory efficiently. 🧹
