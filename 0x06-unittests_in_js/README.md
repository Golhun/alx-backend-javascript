# Unit Testing in JavaScript: Mocha, Chai, Sinon & Express

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the fundamentals of unit testing in JavaScript. It covers key testing tools and methodologies, including **Mocha** for running test suites, **Chai** for assertions, **Sinon** for spies and stubs, and **Express** for API testing. The objective is to equip you with the necessary skills to test both simple and complex JavaScript applications effectively.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently:

- Use **Mocha** to write test suites for JavaScript applications.
- Integrate **Chai** for behavior-driven testing with assertions.
- Understand and apply **Sinon** to use spies and stubs to mock and verify function behaviors.
- Handle testing of asynchronous functions.
- Write integration tests for small web servers built with **Express**.
- Test both simple functions and larger, integrated systems.

## Key Tools and Concepts

- **Mocha**: A test framework that allows you to run your test suites, with features like `describe()`, `it()`, and hooks like `before()` and `after()`.
- **Chai**: An assertion library that helps you verify that the application behaves as expected.
- **Sinon**: A library to create spies, stubs, and mocks, allowing you to test the behavior of functions without executing their real implementations.
- **Express**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used in testing integration with HTTP requests and responses.
- **Async Testing**: Handling asynchronous operations in tests using callbacks or promises.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing how components of the application work together, especially important for web servers and APIs.
